# TheShow-Investment-Tool

At the beginning of MLB the Show 23's lifecycle I wanted to find a way to make stubs and have a competitive team without breaking the bank(college student and all that).
To solve this there was two main methods: flipping or investing. Flipping takes a lot of manual work having to change prices to adjust to people overcutting the price you wish to buy for.
So with time also being another issue, there was only one way to fix this problem, investing. But I also don't have time to look into players to invest so I joined an investment group.
That's where this tool comes in, my plan is to make this a sort of assistant tool. To help track profits made not only overall but per card as well. Also, there is a problem
with the investment group. That problem is that people will fight each other instead of working together when selling cards and buying cards. For buying cards, there isn't much I can do.
For selling cards, I want to track the players I have invested in, the buy price of those players, and the current price. That way I can know when to sell without having to manually
check the price of the card everytime. Possibly create my own alert of when to sell.
